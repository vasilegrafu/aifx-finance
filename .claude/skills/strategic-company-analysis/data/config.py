"""Non-secret settings for service providers — the twin of credentials.py.

Adapted from finance-reports/service_providers/config.py (2026-08-25);
self-contained on purpose, reading the SAME project-root files.

    <project>/config.<env>.json     TRACKED     api_url, anything not secret
    <project>/secrets.<env>.json    GITIGNORED  api_key, and nothing else

TWO FILES, AND THE SPLIT IS PER-FILE RATHER THAN PER-FIELD, so "is this safe to
commit?" is decided once for the file. service_provider() refuses an `api_key`
here outright.

Both files are chosen by the SAME environment, so a run cannot read dev config
against a prod key. There is no default; see credentials.resolve().
