"""Where the FMP key comes from — and, more importantly, where it must not be.

Adapted from finance-reports/service_providers/fmp/credentials.py (2026-08-25);
self-contained on purpose. BOTH skills read the SAME project-root files, so
there is one key, one gitignore rule, and no second secret surface.

THIS REPOSITORY IS PUBLIC and jsDelivr's `/gh/` path publishes it, so a key
committed anywhere under it is fetchable at a URL by anyone who guesses the
path. No tracked file carries an `api_key`, and `secrets.*.json` is gitignored
with no exception.

    key:  $FMP_API_KEY  ->  <project>/secrets.<env>.json  ->  hard error
    env:  $ENVIRONMENT  ->  <project>/environment.json    ->  hard error

First hit wins, and there is deliberately no third place either looks.

NO DEFAULT AT ANY POINT. One declaration selects both the config file and the
secrets file, so a run cannot read dev settings against a prod key, and every
run prints what it resolved and from where before it spends a call.
